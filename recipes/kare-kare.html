    <p>Kare Kare is a traditional Filipino stew complimented 
        with a thick savory peanut sauce. 
        The commonly used meats for this dish are ox tail, tripe, and pork leg; 
        on some occasions goat and chicken meat are also used. Besides the peanuts, 
        this dish depends on the shrimp paste (on the side) in order to be fully enjoyed. T
        raditionally, “palayok” (clay cooking pot) is used to cook this dish and it is also 
        used as the serving pot.</p>
